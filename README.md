# TODO

- place track
    - hovering over one side of destination tile vs other changes which side path from start tile to dest. tile gets drawn
- delete track
- click on switch to cycle active
- add/remove row/column
- export
- add/remove multiple rows/columns
- import

## nice to have / future
- rework edit paradigm to something like
    1. Select tiles
    2. Choose one of 
        - stroke track (with sub options like straight, linear, curved, etc.)
        - clear/delete track
- local storage
- autosave
- background image support? (unused center char)

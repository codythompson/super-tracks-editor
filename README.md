# TODO

- BUG: adding track to track that already exists in newAtlas will result in multiple exitPairs of the same value being added to exitPairs
- edit single tile
- add/remove row/column
- export
- add/remove multiple rows/columns
- import

## nice to have / future
- place track is a little wonky, make it less wonky
- add new mode that lets you do something like
    1. Select tiles
    2. Choose one of 
        - stroke track (with sub options like straight, linear, curved, etc.)
        - clear/delete track
- local storage
- autosave
- background image support? (unused center char)

# TODO

- add support typing a hyphen into resize dialog for negative values

## nice to have / future
- place track is a little wonky, make it less wonky
- use svgs instead of "creative" use of box-shadow
- add new mode that lets you do something like
    1. Select tiles
    2. Choose one of 
        - stroke track (with sub options like straight, linear, curved, etc.)
        - clear/delete track
- background image support? (unused center char)

# TODO

## image editor

- add functionality and control bar buttons for editing width and color
- add functionality and control bar buttons for selecting multiple in-active connections
- save button
- svg patterned transparent background
- refactor control bar for use in both editors
- create map editor component to encapsulate map editor only logic/jsx

## map editor

    - add support typing a hyphen into resize dialog for negative values

### nice to have / future
- place track is a little wonky, make it less wonky
- use svgs instead of "creative" use of box-shadow
- add new mode that lets you do something like
    1. Select tiles
    2. Choose one of 
        - stroke track (with sub options like straight, linear, curved, etc.)
        - clear/delete track
- background image support? (unused center char)

# TODO

- place track
    - need way to commit new track. I was thinking button in the control bar
- delete track
- add/remove row/column
- export
- add/remove multiple rows/columns
- import

## nice to have / future
- rework edit paradigm (or add new mode?) to something like
    1. Select tiles
    2. Choose one of 
        - stroke track (with sub options like straight, linear, curved, etc.)
        - clear/delete track
- local storage
- autosave
- background image support? (unused center char)
